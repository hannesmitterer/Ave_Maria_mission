PROPOSAL FOR SUDAN RELIEF FUND
SUBJECT: Urgent Water Infrastructure Expansion - Ave Maria Mission, Tombura-Yambio

1. SITUATION ANALYSIS
Ave Maria Mission remains the primary stabilizer in a region currently devoid of major NGO presence (WFP, UNICEF absent). Following recent clashes, the mission is now hosting 7,326 internally displaced persons (IDPs) directly on mission grounds, with an additional ~3,000 in the immediate host community.

2. PROBLEM STATEMENT
Our existing water infrastructure was designed for a quiet parish community. It is now supporting over 10,000 lives. The critical water shortage poses an imminent threat of waterborne diseases (cholera/typhoid), particularly threatening the 1,027 children now attending our school and the patients at our medical dispensary.

3. PROPOSAL
We urgently request funding for:
- Drilling of 1x Deep Borehole (high-capacity).
- Installation of a Solar-Powered Pumping System (due to lack of fuel/electricity).
- Construction of elevated storage tanks for gravity-fed distribution to the IDP camp and school blocks.

4. IMPACT
This project will immediately secure safe drinking water for the IDP population, reduce the burden on women and children fetching water from unsafe sources, and ensure the hygiene standards of the CMMB-supported medical facility.

5. BUDGET ESTIMATE
Total Required: $18,500 USD (Includes logistics for transport of rig 9 hours from Yambio).

We await your urgent response to prevent a secondary health crisis.
